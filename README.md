Retro-BDD Kata
==============

# The system currently implements a cancellation policy that we have forgotten. 
Retro-discover the scenarios implemented in the code
 
# On May 5th we want to advertize a brand new policy whereby you can cancel your order even after your product has been shipped but has not yet been delivered. For that particular case you need to call the Customer assistance and ask for a cancellation number.

 - Propose examples / scenarios to make sure we all understand the new behavior
 - Implement the new behavior behind a feature toggle with Cucumber-jvm or Specflow
